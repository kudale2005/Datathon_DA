Problem Statement:
Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and long-term disability worldwide. Early detection and prevention can save lives. The goal of this project is to analyze healthcare data to identify key factors influencing stroke occurrence and to build a predictive model that can estimate the likelihood of a stroke based on patient information.


Objective:

To explore the relationship between patient lifestyle, medical history, and stroke occurrence.

To preprocess, visualize, and analyze healthcare data effectively.

To develop and evaluate machine learning models for stroke prediction.

To create a data-driven dashboard/report summarizing findings and model results.


Expected Outcome:

A predictive model that accurately classifies whether a person is at risk of stroke.

Insightful visualizations showing how factors like age, BMI, glucose, and lifestyle contribute to stroke risk.

A final report and dashboard summarizing results.
